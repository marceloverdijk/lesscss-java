Official LESS CSS Compiler for Java
===================================

LESS CSS Compiler for Java is a library to compile LESS sources to CSS stylesheets.

The compiler uses Rhino, Envjs (simulated browser environment written in JavaScript), and the official LESS JavaScript compiler.

Look at the simple example below to compile LESS to CSS:
 
    // Instantiate the LESS compiler
    LessCompiler lessCompiler = new LessCompiler();
    
    // Compile LESS input string to CSS output string
    String css = lessCompiler.compile("@color: #4D926F; #header { color: @color; }");
    
    // Or compile LESS input file to CSS output file
    lessCompiler.compile(new File("main.less"), new File("main.css"));

To learn more about LESS, please see http://lesscss.org/.


Getting Started
---------------

Maven users should add the library using the following dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.lesscss</groupId>
      <artifactId>lesscss</artifactId>
      <version>1.3.0</version>
    </dependency>

(lesscss-java is in the Maven Central repository.)

Non-Maven users should download the latest version and add it to the project's classpath. Also the following dependencies are required:

+ <a href="http://commons.apache.org/io/">Apache Commons IO 2.1</a>
+ <a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang/">Apache Commons Lang 3.1</a>
+ <a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">Apache Commons Logging 1.1.1</a>
+ <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino: JavaScript for Java 1.7R3</a>


Compatibility
-------------

The LESS CSS Compiler for Java contains all LESS compatibility tests. All tests pass, except the @import test case which fails partially as the compiler does not support the media query import feature (yet).

The project also contains integration tests for compiling the Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) library. If you are using another 3th party LESS library you want to be added to the integration tests, just create a issue and provide a link to the library.
